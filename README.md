## Who are our stakeholders?
Our stakeholders are small-business owners who are women and/or a minority, as well as economically disadvantaged business owners. 

## What problem are we trying to solve?
Considering the current equity-focused programs that the EPA has implemented, what contributes to the inequity in contract awards for small, disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses? 

## How will you solve the problem?
We propose that the best way to close the gap for small, disadvantaged businesses is to focus on maximizing the amount received from the initial contract. That is, to increase the federal obligation amount rather than the potential award.

It is highly beneficial for women-owned businesses to enroll in the 8(a) program. This program increases the potential value of the award and increases the amount actually received. Minoity-owned businesses also receive and increase the potential value of the award but do not tend to increase the actual amount received. To accommodate this, all disadvantaged businesses should form a partnership rather than a sole proprietorship. 

Companies are run differently from business to business. We created the suggestions above to apply to a wide variety of disadvantaged businesses.
