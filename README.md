## Who are our stakeholders?
Our stakeholders are small-business owners who are women and/or a minority.
As well as economically disadvantaged business owners. 

## What problem are we trying to solve?
Considering the current equity-focused programs that the EPA has implemented, what contributes to the inequity in contract awards for small, disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses? 

## How will you solve the problem?
We propose that the best way to close the gap is for small, disadvantaged businesses is to focus on maximizing the amount recievd from the initial contract. That is, to increase the federal obligation amount from the potential award.

It is highly beneficial for women-owned businesses to enroll in the 8(a) program. This program increases the potential value of the award and increases the amount actually recieved. Minoity owned businesses also recieve and increase in potential value of the award but does not tend to increase the actual amount recieved. To accomidate this, all disadvantaged businesses should forming a partnership rather than a sole proprietorship. 

Companies are run so differently from business to business, so we do not feel comfortable providing a "one size fits all" recommendation for what business owners should do to mitigate this problem, however the above suggestions provide a tangible actions companies can take today.
